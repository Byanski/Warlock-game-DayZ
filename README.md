# Using this boilerplate template

Clone this repo and start populating with your game.

This is primarily comprised of two components; an install script (`src/installer.sh`) and a management interface (`src/manage.py`).

The install script is responsible for creating the necessary directory structure,
installing dependencies, setting up the environment, and installing the game manager.

The Python manager is responsible for installing and updating the actual game binary
and interfacing with all components within the game such as configuration and game API.

(The Python manager handles installation/updates to allow the operator to update the game server without re-running the installer.)

## Directory Structure

The notable directories are:

### `src/`

Contains the scripts which will get compiled.
Refer to [Scripts Collection Builder by eVAL](https://github.com/eVAL-Agency/ScriptsCollection) for documentation
on using the compiler and what inline flags are supported.

In short, it just glues together a bunch of scripts into a single, distributable file.

To make changes to your installer, **do so in src/!**.

### `scripts/`

Not to be confused with src, this directory contains supplemental files used by scripts within src.
These do not get compiled, but are instead referenced by the scripts in src.

* configs.yaml - A YAML file containing configuration data for your game.

### `media/`

Contains media assets for your game, such as images, audio files, etc.
It is recommended to provide at least:

* small logo, 128x128 in WEBP format
* medium size thumbnail, 640x400 in WEBP format
* full size teaser image, 1920x1080 in WEBP format

_WEBP is preferred for its balance of quality and file size, but PNG and JPG are also acceptable._

### `dist/`

This directory will contain the compiled output of your game installer.
By default this will contain `installer.sh`, `manage.py`, `community_scripts.json`, and `warlock.yaml`.

* The installer is the primary end point for installing the library.
* The manager is a utility script for managing the installed game and interfacing with [Warlock](https://github.com/BitsNBytes25/Warlock).
* community_scripts.json is a manifest file for [Tactical RMM](https://github.com/amidaware/tacticalrmm) (not generally used here)
* warlock.yaml is a configuration file for Warlock.


## Editing installer

The installer (`src/installer.sh`) is the main script that users will run to install your game.


### Metadata

In the header of the installer, ensure to update:

* `@AUTHOR` - Your name or your organization's name, optionally with your email address inside `< ... >` brackets.
* `@WARLOCK-TITLE` - Short name to display in Warlock
* `@WARLOCK-IMAGE` - Relative or absolute path to the image file to use in Warlock, ie 'media/game-1920x1080.webp'
* `@WARLOCK-ICON` - Relative or absolute path to the icon file to use in Warlock, ie 'media/game-128x128.webp'
* `@WARLOCK-THUMBNAIL` - Relative or absolute path to the thumbnail file to use in Warlock, ie 'media/game-640x480.webp'
* `Supports:` - A list of operating systems your game supports, ie: 'Debian 12, 13 (newline) Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04'
* `Syntax:` - List of command line arguments the installer supports


### Variable Declaration

Towards the top of the installer are the group of variables that define your game's properties.
These are used within the installer and optionally `scripts/` files.


### Scriptlet Includes

Many tasks of the installer are imported scriptlets from other projects,
thanks to the functionality as provided by [the compiler](https://github.com/eVAL-Agency/ScriptsCollection).

`# scriptlet:_common/package_install.sh` provides a function `package_install` used for installing system packages for example.


## Editing Manager

The manager (`src/manage.py`) is a utility script that users can run to manage the installed game.
It also serves as the interface between your game and [Warlock](https://github.com/BitsNBytes25/Warlock).

### Game Application

Just like installer.sh, the manager can also import scriptlets.

This is notable for the path environmental setup to ensure that `.venv` path is used for Python dependencies.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
# import:org_python/venv_path_include.py

# ... rest of imports
```

This import will be replaced with the scriptlet to assign `.venv` as the source for imports for the rest of the script.

For games that rely on Steam as the installation backend, the following import
provides `SteamApp`:

```python
from warlock_manager.apps.steam_app import SteamApp

...

class GameApp(SteamApp):
```

For games that do not use Steam, the base application can be used instead for `BaseApp`:

```python
from warlock_manager.apps.base_app import BaseApp

... 

class GameApp(BaseApp):
```

For games with no backend provider, you will need to ensure to setup your own `update` and `check_update_available` methods.

```python
def check_update_available(self) -> bool:
	"""
	Check if a SteamCMD update is available for this game

	:return:
	"""
	# Do the tasks necessary to check for an update

def update(self):
	"""
	Update the game server via SteamCMD

	:return:
	"""
	# Do the necessary tasks to update the game binary
```


## Game Service

Similar to the game application, each service (instance/map) has its own type; this is based on the API 
mechanism provided by the game itself.  Common types are `BaseService`, `HTTPService`, and `RCONService`.

The main function of the service is configurations for the game instance and interfacing with the game environment
via available API for the respective game.


## Building your Installer

Prior to development, you can run `setup-dev.sh` to create a local `.venv` virtual environment
for Warlock-Manager and its dependencies and to update the compiler to the latest version.

Once you have populated the `src/` directory with your scripts, you can build your installer by running:

```bash
./compile.py
```

This will generate:

* `dist/installer.sh` - Bundled installation script and entry point
* `dist/manage.py` - Bundled management interface and Warlock API
* `dist/community_scripts.json` - TacticalRMM package information
* `dist/warlock.yaml` - Warlock application metadata


## Deploying to Warlock

To deploy your game to Warlock for local testing copy the contents of warlock.yaml
and add it to `Apps.yaml` in Warlock.

To contribute your game to the greater community,
please issue a merge request with your metadata added
or create a [new request](https://github.com/BitsNBytes25/Warlock/issues/new/choose) with your metadata.
